Hi! I am Haolin Liu, a third-year PhD student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chen-Yu Wei](https://bahh723.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I studied chemistry for 1.5 years before transitioning to computer science for 2.5 years. 

I am interested in developing principled and practical algorithms for **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and understanding the training dynamic of these algorithms. Recently, I mainly focus on RL theory and RL for LLM reasoning.

- On the theoretical side, I aim to uncover unified principles for RL algorithm design and identify the minimal structural assumptions needed for sample-efficient RL. My recent works ([[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08882), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05974)) propose the most unified frameworks for RL theory to date, capable of handling both model-based and model-free RL in stationary and non-stationary environments.
- On the practical side, I study the limitations of existing RL algorithms and develop new methods to overcome them. Recently, I have focused on better leveraging process supervision in RL and designing new exploration strategies to enhance LLM reasoning.
