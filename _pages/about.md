Hi! I am Haolin Liu, a third-year PhD student at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chen-Yu Wei](https://bahh723.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I studied chemistry for 1.5 years before transitioning to computer science for 2.5 years. I finished my undergraduate thesis with Prof. [Dengji Zhao](http://dengji-zhao.net/).

My research is centered on <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)<b>, spanning both theoretical and practical domains. On the theoretical side, I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of how RL algorithms can effectively learn and adapt in dynamic environments. Practically, 
I specialize in applying RL to the post-training of large language models (LLMs), with a particular emphasis on alignment and reasoning. I also have some experience in game theory and mechanism design.
